    Cell toolkit is a small library for OS/2 PM. It was designed to
simplify implementation of two important parts of user interface (UI):

    - Split views
    - Toolbars

    What is split view? This is representation of information in one
window splitted vertically or horizontally into two or more parts
with splitbar which can be moved by user.
You can meet this technique in many popular applications, such as
PMMail, Netscape Navigator, ProNews and many more.

More detailed information is in doc/ subdirectory of the package.
Note that documents present there are different (i.e. english
document is not a translation of russian one and vice versa).

    Toolkit is distributed under BSD-like license.
Refer to license.txt for more details.
